# SimpleDB_Assignment_1

Using Python's own Dictionary object, with list and key:values, I've created a 
simple "datastore" of a fictional medical office. 
Incl. How to access, edit, store/write to file and read values from file again. 

The only requirement for the user is to have Python setup correctly, with the "json" dependency installed for our 
read/write purposes and "jupyter notebook" runnning Python 3+ 
(If you so choose to selec & clone the "jupyter notebook"-formatted assignment), which I recommend. 

The source code is well commented in each block of code and should guide the respective receiver nicely, 
and clarify the functionality of the DB nicely.
